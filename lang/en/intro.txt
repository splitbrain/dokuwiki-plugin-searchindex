====== SearchIndex Manager ======

This page allows you to update or rebuild the index used by the full-text search.
This is generally not needed as the index builds and updates itself as
users browse your wiki. However if you just upgraded, added or removed
a lot of files it may be a good idea to clean up the index.

Rebuilding the index **can take a long time**. You should leave the page open
until the indexing has finished.

//NOTE: This manager needs a recent browser as it makes use of modern JavaScript
to carry out multiple tasks in the background (using [[wp>AJAX]]).//
